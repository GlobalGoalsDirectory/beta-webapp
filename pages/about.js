          The Global Goals Directory is a public list of startups,
          organizations, and companies working on the 17 UN Sustainable
          Development Goals. The directory is a public good and is completely
          free.
        </Bold>{" "}
        The idea for the Global Goals Directory was born in 2019, out of many
        conversations with thought leaders and innovators from the SDG
        community. Throughout these conversations, we observed one theme
        re-emerging over and over again: The importance of partnerships and
        their critical role for tackling the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
        While many partnerships exist in the SDG community today, a large share
        of them are formed from serendipitous connections â€” people and
        organizations we meet at a workshop, an event, or a webinar. But in a
        network as big as the SDG community, there are thousands of potential
        partners that we have not yet met. The Global Goals Directory exists to
        put the entire SDG community at your fingertips and to make it easy to
        find new collaborators and build new partnerships, so that we as an
        ecosystem can become more connected, more collaborative, and accelerate
        our progress on the 2030 Agenda.
