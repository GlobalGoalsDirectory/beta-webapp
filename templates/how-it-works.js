      Our AI-based methodology for identifying and analyzing organizations

        We have developed a novel approach for the automatic identification and
        classification of startups and organization working on the SDGs, based
        on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and text
        analysis. Our AI-based approach yields two key advantages over manual
        analysis and classification of organizations: First, artificial
        intelligence requires a fraction of the time that a human needs to both
        find and assess organizations (about 2 minutes per organization), while
        simultaneously ensuring a greater degree of consistency and
        comparability. Second, our program can continuously run in the
        background, automatically re-analyzing organizations at least every 90
        days to ensure that results are always up to date. While our specific
        approach and its application are novel, our methodology builds upon
        similar methods for classifying content by SDG that have been tried and
        proven by the{" "}

        Our Approach: Artificial Intelligence
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        Our AI-based approach has been refined over hundreds of hours of
        research and coding. It can be broadly classified into four phases:
        First, an autonomous web scraper crawls the Internet and identifies
        relevant organizations and websites. The content of each website is then
        matched against a list of keywords based on the 17 Sustainable
        Development Goals and their 169 targets to identify which SDGs an
        organization contributes to. Next, a bot queries several public APIs to
        enrich each profile with key metadata, including address, name, and
        logo. Finally, a team of SDG experts reviews the results produced by the
        AI, verifies their accuracy, and makes any changes necessary.

          title="1. Organization Discovery"
        >
          Our autonomous web scraper crawls the Internet and identifies relevant
          organizations and websites. Our scraper downloads a copy of every
          selected website, which is later used for content analysis in phase 2.
          We follow a recursive network approach, similar to what is used by
          search engines like Google: When we find an organization that
          contributes to the UN SDGs, we follow all external, outgoing links
          from the organization's website and scrape those external websites as
          well. This approach allows us to rapidly find and identify the large
          majority of actors across the SDG community.

          title="2. Content Analysis"
        >
          We scan each scraped website for certain keywords to classify startups
          and organizations by the Sustainable Development Goals that they are
          contributing to. We developed these keywords, over 100 in total, based
          on the official language of the 17 SDGs and the 169 targets and
          compiled them in both English and German versions. We then count the
          number of matches found and the frequencies with which these keywords
          appear on the website to assess whether an organization contributes to
          a specific goal. We also determine which goals are an organization's
          primary focus and which ones are side objectives.

          title="3. Metadata Collection"
        >
          After identifying that a startup or organization does indeed
          contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals, we enrich each
          profile with relevant metadata that allows users to make the most from
          the Global Goals Directory. Our fully automatic metadata bot queries
          several public APIs, including social networks, like Twitter,
          Facebook, and LinkedIn, but also service providers, like Google Maps,
          to identify and collect name, logo, address, a short summary, and
          social media profiles for each of the organizations in the directory.
          We take privacy seriously and only collect information that is
          publicly available.

        >
          A team of SDG experts carefully reviews all profiles before they
          appear on the Global Goals Directory. Even though our algorithm has
          been fine-tuned over hundreds of hours of careful research and
          correctly assesses nine out of ten startups and organizations, there
          still remain edge cases and exceptions. In addition to verifying the
          accuracy of the information, the SDG experts are also able to manually
          correct any information on the organizations' profiles. The feedback
          and information provided by the review team feeds back into the
          algorithm, so that the AI becomes more intelligent over time.
