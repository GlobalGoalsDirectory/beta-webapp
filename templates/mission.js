        With less than a decade to go until 2030, we are still facing many major
        challenges when it comes to the achievement of the UN Sustainable
        Development Goals: from climate change and pollution to extreme poverty
        and widening inequalities. What these challenges have in common is that
        they are global, interconnected, and systemic. Issues like these cannot
        be solved by a single organization, company, or government alone.
        Collaboration and partnerships are critical for advancing the 2030
        Agenda on our world's toughest problems during this Decade of Action.

          The Global Goals Directory exists to accelerate our progress on the UN
          Sustainable Development Goals by supporting and facilitating
          collaboration and partnerships between non-profit organizations,
          private companies, think tanks, universities, and governments. We
          pursue this mission in three ways: 1) Championing the UN Sustainable
          Development Goals by highlighting the countless number of
          organizations and companies working on this global agenda, 2)
          facilitating the creation of new partnerships by helping organizations
          find suitable collaborators through our public directory, and 3)
          supporting cities and communities with analyses of their local
          ecosystem of SDG actors and identifying gaps and opportunities.

            Cities and communities play a pivotal role in the implementation of
            the 2030 Agenda. We help cities understand their local ecosystem of
            SDG actors by analyzing and identifying the gaps and challenges that
            exist across each of the 17 SDGs and 169 targets.
