          With less than a decade to go until 2030, we are still facing many
          major challenges when it comes to the achievement of the UN
          Sustainable Development Goals: from climate change and pollution to
          extreme poverty and widening inequalities. What these challenges have
          in common is that they are global, interconnected, and systemic.
          Issues like these cannot be solved by a single organization, company,
          or government alone. Collaboration and partnerships are critical for
          advancing the 2030 Agenda on our world's toughest problems during this
          Decade of Action.

            The Global Goals Directory exists to accelerate our progress on the
            UN Sustainable Development Goals by supporting and facilitating
            collaboration and partnerships between non-profit organizations,
            private companies, think tanks, universities, and governments. We
            pursue this mission in three ways: 1) Championing the UN Sustainable
            Development Goals by highlighting the countless number of
            organizations and companies working on this global agenda, 2)
            facilitating the creation of new partnerships by helping
            organizations find suitable collaborators through our public
            directory, and 3) supporting cities and communities with analyses of
            their local ecosystem of SDG actors and identifying gaps and
            opportunities.

              Around the world, tens of thousands of organizations, companies,
              and governments are working towards the achievement of the UN
              Sustainable Development Goals. Our mission is to give visibility
              to this great SDG community and to champion the 2030 Agenda.

              Cities and communities play a pivotal role in the implementation
              of the 2030 Agenda. We help cities understand their local
              ecosystem of SDG actors by analyzing and identifying the gaps and
              challenges that exist across each of the 17 SDGs and 169 targets.
